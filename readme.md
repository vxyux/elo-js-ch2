## Preface
As I read through the 'Eloquent Javascript' book that a collegue on my internship recommended, the author challenged the reader in chapter 2 to do these exercises to get a better grasp at Javascript. And so I opened up my IDE and got to work!

## Exercises
The exercises were made in the following order:
- Triangle (tree)
- FizzBuzz
- Chessboard

## Setup
To be clear, this repo has the solutions to all of the 3 puzzles. I made these in Visual Studio Code, so I'm assuming you're using that IDE.

When cloned, click on one of the files and simply right click a blank space in the IDE. Then in the sub-menu choose the first option: "Run Code" or use the shortcut: "Shift + Option + N".

Happy programming!
